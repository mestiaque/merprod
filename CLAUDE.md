# Merchandising v2 — `mestiaque/merchandising-sfl`

Guide for Claude Code working in this package. Read it before changing anything.

## What this is

The **only** merchandising + production module of the Suhana Fashions ERP. In the sidebar it is **three top-level menus** (`Config/sidebar.php`, one group, in this order): **Merchandising** (dashboard, masters, dev, order + BOM, samples, reports), **Planning** (setup, bulletin, T&A, T&A Sheet, T&A Status) and **Production** (status, fabric requisition, cutting … packing, production reports). "v2" is just how we call the package internally.
It covers inquiry → style / tech pack → costing → samples → order + PO → BOM → bulletin → T&A → production
(cutting … packing) → Finish Store (Inventory), plus dashboard, post-costing and reports.

- Package path: `/home/estiaque/Desktop/NIT/SFL/merchandising-sfl` (Laravel 12, PHP 8.3+)
- Host app: `/home/estiaque/Desktop/NIT/erp-suhana` (path repo, symlinked into `vendor/mestiaque/merchandising-sfl`). Run `php artisan …` from the host.
- Dev DB: `suhana_erp_actual` (MySQL). Host tests use a different DB (`suhana_erp`) that is not migrated.
- The old packages **MerchandisingTrace (v1, `mer_*`) and production-trace (`trc_*`) were removed on 2026-10-05** (composer removed, tables dropped; backups in `erp-suhana/storage/app/backups/2026-10-05_*`). Never re-introduce them or reference `ME\MerchandisingTrace` / `ME\ProductionTrace`. The folders may still exist on disk — ignore them.

### Working with the user
- The user writes Banglish / Bengali. **Reply in Bengali.**
- Don't commit unless asked. This package's git repo has no commits yet.
- Ask before destructive or hard-to-reverse steps (dropping tables, composer changes, deleting data). Dry-run in a DB transaction first.
- The user does **not** want any master data entered twice across modules (see "Who owns which master").

## Naming

| | |
|---|---|
| Namespace | `ME\MerchandisingSfl` (`src/`) |
| Tables | `msfl_*` |
| Routes | prefix `admin/merchandising-sfl`, names `msfl.*` (config `merchandising-sfl.route`) |
| Views | `merchandising-sfl::admin.*` (`src/resources/views/admin`) |
| Permissions | three groups like the sidebar — `MERCHANDISING`, `PLANNING`, `PRODUCTION` (`Config/permission.php`); keys `msfl_<module>.<action>` (list / add / edit / view / delete / approve / all) |
| Document numbers | `<PREFIX>-<YYYY>-<0001>` via `Services/DocumentNumberService` (prefixes in `Config/config.php`: INQ CST ORD BOM SMP BLT TNA CUT) |

## Who owns which master (no duplicates!)

| Master | Owner | v2 reads it through |
|---|---|---|
| Buyers (with approval), Styles (Master Data → Styles = same `msfl_styles` as Tech Pack, same permission `msfl_style`), Seasons, Product Types, Wash Types, Ship Modes, Factories, Currencies, Item Categories, Items (fabric & trims for costing/BOM), Sample Types, Garment Parts, Machine Types, Operations | **v2** | `Support/MasterRegistry` (+ `Lines` screen) |
| Departments, Holidays, Floor-lines | **HR** (`hr_departments`, `hr_holidays`, `hr_floor_lines`) | read-only models `Models/Department`, `Models/Holiday`, `Models/FloorLine` |
| Colors, Sizes, Units (UOM), Suppliers, Machines, Stores, stock items | **Inventory** (`inv_*`) | read-only models `Models/Color`, `Size`, `Uom` (`code` accessor = short_name), `Supplier`; machines via `Services/InventoryMachines` |

- A v2 **Line** = an HR floor-line (`msfl_lines.hr_floor_line_id`) + planning figures (operators, minutes, efficiency). `Line::code` = HR line name ("Line 2"), `name` = "Floor 1 · Line 2".
- **Machine Types** are synced from Inventory machine `type` text (`msfl_machine_types.inv_type`); a line's machines are counted from Inventory machines whose `line` = the HR line name. Only helper workplaces (MAN, IRON) are added by hand.
- Columns pointing at HR / Inventory tables have **no DB foreign key** (soft reference + index) so deleting there never fails because of v2. Validation uses `Rule::exists('inv_…')->whereNull('deleted_at')`.
- Before adding any new master: check `hr_*`, `inv_*`, `msfl_*` for an existing one. Ask the user only if ownership is genuinely unclear.

## Process flow and where the code is

| Step | Screen (route) | Code |
|---|---|---|
| Masters | `msfl.masters.*` (`masters/{master}`) | `MasterController` + `Support/MasterRegistry` (fields, columns, `note`, `before_index` hook). New buyer → `submitForApproval()` |
| Inquiry | `msfl.inquiries.*` | `InquiryController`, `Models/Inquiry` |
| Style / tech pack | `msfl.styles.*` (+ images) | `StyleController`, `FileUploadService`. A style is created only in Master Data → Styles; New Tech Pack picks one (`Style::withoutTechPack()`, `style_id`) and writes `Style::TECH_PACK_FIELDS` onto it; Style No / Name / Buyer are read-only there |
| Cost sheet (per dozen) — **Open Cost Sheet** layout (as the user liked in v1): letterhead, particulars + Tech Pack pictures (front / back / artwork), sections **A Fabric · B Accessories · C Wash · D Stone · E Print · F Heat Seal · G Embroidery / other process** (`CostSheet::GROUPS` = [letter, title, total label]; old `process` lines = G), line supplier, sketch + SUMMARY (DZN / PC / % of FOB, TTL B2B), per-piece strip (PKT / fusing split out of fabric by name); form has the same layout with a live summary; CM / dz = SMV ÷ efficiency × CPM × 12 when not typed | `msfl.cost-sheets.*`, `.approve`, print = show `?print=1` | `CostSheet::recalculate()` derives the stored totals (`GROUP_COLUMNS`: C–G add to `process_cost`, so post costing is unchanged), `CostSheet::summary()` the sheet figures (same math: commercial % on materials, profit % on total, FOB = total + profit), `cmFromMinutes()`; views `cost-sheets/partials/sheet`, `form`, `line-row` |
| Samples | `msfl.samples.*`, `.submit`, `.decide`, `.status` | `SampleController`, `Services/SampleDecision` (shared with central Approvals) |
| Order + PO lines (size breakdown) — **one page**: header + PO lines table (`size_ids[]` = sizes this order uses → size columns, `Size::displaySort()` XS→3XL; `pos[]` rows: PO No, style (filtered by buyer; a PO can have several styles, one row each), color = the style's `msfl_styles.color_id` (Master Data → Styles, locked in the row; picked by hand only for a style without a color), qty per size, price, PCD, shipment, ship mode, Emb / Wash / … flags, remarks; add / copy / remove row) saved together on create and edit; show page lists the lines read-only | `msfl.orders.*`, `.status` (confirm); `msfl.orders.pos.*` = one-line API kept for scripts (demo seeder) | `OrderController` + `OrderRequest` (blank rows dropped, sizes outside `size_ids` dropped, style color overrides the row color (also in `OrderPoRequest`), `Row N:` errors, style of the order's buyer, no duplicate PO·style, shipment ≥ PCD, removed lines must be unused), `Services/OrderPoLines` (`save()` logs revisions after confirm, `sync()`, `usedIn()` — cutting / entries / sewing plans / requisitions / Inventory docs block removal), `OrderPo::syncSizes()` |
| BOM | `msfl.boms.*`, `.approve`, `.revise` | `BomController`, `BomItem::requiredQty()` |
| Lines / Bulletin | `msfl.lines.*`, `msfl.bulletins.*` (+ print) | `LineController`, `Models/Bulletin::recalculate()/machineSummary()` |
| T&A plan | `msfl.tna.*`, `.tasks.update`, `.recalculate` | `TnaPlanController`, `Services/TnaPlanner`, `WorkingCalendar` |
| T&A Sheet (81 cols, buyer format) | `msfl.tna-sheet.index`, `.print` | `TnaSheetController`, `Services/TnaSheet` |
| Fabric requisition | `msfl.production.requisitions.*` (+ show: items requested / approved / issued, issue challans by date) | creates an **Inventory** `InvRequisition` (+ central approval); store approves/issues in Inventory. Reports `requisition-details` / `requisition-summary` (buyer, style, dates) read `msfl_prod_fabric_requisitions` → `inv_requisition_items` / `inv_issue_items` |
| Cutting (sizes, parts, auto bundles) | `msfl.production.cuttings.*` | `Production/CuttingController` |
| Embroidery / Washing / Finishing / Final QC / Packing | `msfl.production.entries.*` (`production/{stage}`); embroidery & washing: `?mode=input` (send) / `?mode=output` (receive back) — separate entries, own dates (`ProductionFlow::SPLIT_STAGES`) | `Production/EntryController`, `Services/ProductionFlow` |
| Sewing (line-wise) | `msfl.production.sewing.*` (`production/sewing`: board with Line Input / Hourly Output **modals** (also per row), `print`, `entries`; GET `input` / `hourly` just open the board with `?modal=`) — board = Daily Production sheet per line × PO (hourly output, Today / Previous / Grand, DHU, efficiency) | `Production/SewingController`, `Services/SewingBoard`, `Models/Production/SewingPlan` (`msfl_prod_sewing_plans`: target, hours, SMV, operators, helpers per line-day-PO; defaults from the style's Bulletin → style SMV → line); entries carry `hour_slot` (config `sewing_hours`, `sewing_break_hour`) |
| Daily Hourly Production Report (buyer sheet: per line × PO three rows Output / Efficiency / DHU per hour + Input Start, Running Day, Target Eff %, Hourly Target, Remarks; grand total) | `msfl.production.hourly-report.index` / `.print` (`production/sewing/hourly-report`, `?date=`, `line_id`) | `SewingController::hourlyReport()`, `SewingBoard::rows()` (`hour_eff`, `hour_dhu`, `target_eff`, `input_start`, `running_day`; totals the same over lines) |
| QC (step-wise, cutting … finishing) / Rework (any step but packing) — two sidebar items; each opens a **card per step**, a card opens that step's form | `msfl.production.qc.*`, `msfl.production.rework.*` (route default `kind`, `?stage=`) | `Production/QcReworkController` — entries with `kind` qc / rework. Stage `final_qc` is labelled **Buyer QC** (ready-product QC), its own menu |
| Daily Targets (Planning → Setup) | `msfl.masters.*` (`masters/daily-targets`) | `Models/DailyTarget` (`msfl_daily_targets`: date, cutting target, packing (poly) target, required FOB value per sewing line) |
| Line Wise Output (WIP) report (sewing line × style + planning value per line + factory cutting / poly / shipout; day + month to date) | `msfl.reports.show` `line-output` (`?date=`, `line_id`) | `Reports::lineOutput()` — same sewing figures as `SewingBoard`, CM = approved cost sheet `cm_cost` ÷ 12, FOB = PO `unit_price`, shipout = Inventory shipment lines with `msfl_order_po_id`. A report can return several tables (`sections`) and subtotal rows (`row_classes`) |
| Production status per PO | `msfl.production.status.*` | `Production/StatusController` |
| Finish Store receive | Inventory `inventory.fg-receives.*` | capped by v2 packed qty (`SflInventory\Services\MerchandisingLink::finishSummary`) |
| Post cost sheet | `msfl.post-costing.*` (+ print) | `Services/PostCosting` |
| Dashboard | `msfl.dashboard` (+ host home widget) | `Services/DashboardStats`, `partials/dashboard-widget` |
| Reports | `msfl.reports.*` (`reports/{report}` + print) | `Services/Reports::LIST` / `run()`, one generic view |

## Domain rules (keep these true)

**Production (`Services/ProductionFlow`)**
- Route per PO: `cutting → [embroidery] → sewing → [washing] → finishing → final_qc → packing`; embroidery / washing only when `msfl_order_pos.needs_embroidery / needs_washing`.
- **Embroidery is part-wise** (`ProductionFlow::PART_STAGES`, `msfl_prod_entries.part_name`): cut parts (Front …) are sent cutting → embroidery and come back to cutting. **Cutting balance** = cut pass − parts still out at embroidery (`out` = sent − returned, rejects never return; max over parts) − sewing input (`ProductionFlow::cuttingBalance()`); sewing takes from it, embroidery can send a part only from it and never more than cut − already sent. Summary row `embroidery` has `parts` => per-part rows (+ `out`). Cutting / embroidery QC and rework must name the part (`ProductionFlow::partWise()`); every part field (Parts Cut, embroidery, QC / rework, defect rows) is a select from **Master Data → Garment Parts** (`msfl_garment_parts`, `Lookups::garmentParts()`, validated with `exists`); entries store the part **name**. `poParts()` = parts cut for a PO (hint / balances).
- Step screens (embroidery … packing) record **input + output (pass) only**; embroidery / washing as two separate entries (send / receive back). Sewing: line input by date, output / reject / rework **hourly** (rejects there need no defect rows). Other reject / rework go through the QC / Rework screens. Only Buyer QC (`final_qc`) keeps pass / rework / reject + defect rows on its own screen. Older production entries may still carry reject / rework — summary handles them. Cutting "passes" all it cuts.
- Cutting parts are per size (`msfl_prod_cutting_parts.size_id`); color = the PO's color (a cutting is one PO). Production PO selects show **style · color — buyer** (no order / PO no; ship date only when style + color repeat).
- **Size-wise**: every new entry (stage, QC, rework) needs a size of the PO; style / color come from the PO. `summary($po, $ignore, $sizeId)` gives the same figures for one size (cut of that size + that size's entries); `validate()` / QC-rework checks use the size **and** the PO total (older entries without a size still count). Part only on cutting / embroidery.
- Entry `kind`: `production` (stage screens), `qc` = **QC pass / reject only** among pieces the stage already passed (qc pass is just counted; reject leaves pass; older qc entries may carry rework), `rework` = **rework found** (`rework_qty`: leaves pass, back to WIP) and / or rework fixed (pass / reject out of WIP). QC and Rework are separate screens — never put rework on the QC screen. Cutting has only qc / rework entries. Keep these screens simple — the user found earlier designs too complicated. Anything summing `pass_qty` directly must use `ProductionFlow::NET_PASS_SQL` — prefer `ProductionFlow::summary()`.
- Found ≤ `ProductionFlow::ready()` (passed, not yet taken by the next stage); fixed ≤ WIP. `deleteBlocked()` refuses deletes that break `input = pass + reject + wip` or leave the next stage with more than this one passed.
- `can take in = previous stage pass − this stage input`; `WIP = input − pass − reject` (rework stays in WIP until it passes; rejects leave the flow).
- Guards: input ≤ can take in; pass + reject ≤ pieces in stage; reject/rework must be broken into defect rows that add up; part / Inventory machine on a defect row are optional at every stage (machine = machine-wise rejection in Defect Analysis); the PO row is locked during the check; you can't delete a cutting / entry whose pieces a later stage already took.
- Only **confirmed** orders go into production (`Lookups::productionPos()`).

**T&A (`Services/TnaPlanner`)**
- Dates count back from shipment in working days (weekly off `MERCHANDISING_SFL_WEEKLY_OFF`, default Friday; HR holidays, ranges expanded).
- `syncAutoActuals()` (runs when a T&A page opens) fills actual dates from `auto_source`: order_confirmed, bom_approved, bulletin_approved, sample_submitted:/sample_approved:<CODE>, fabric_inhouse (first posted Buyer Store GRN of the style), cutting_started, sewing_started, sewing_done / washing_done / finishing_done / final_qc_done / packing_done.
- "Stage done" = full order qty cut and nothing waiting / in WIP at that stage or upstream; date = that stage's last entry.
- Bulletin SMV 0 must not hide the style SMV.

**T&A Sheet (`Services/TnaSheet`)** — one row per PO, 9 groups / 81 columns. Cells come from earlier processes (order, inquiry, style, PO + `msfl_order_po_revisions`, cost sheet, BOM YY, samples, Buyer Store GRNs for fabric consignments & trims keywords). Columns without a source are T&A tasks (codes like `FILE_HANDOVER`, `PILOT_STITCHING`, `FABRIC_LC` in the default template). PCD check: PASS / FAIL ("Cut started before …" or PCD passed without cutting) / PENDING.

**PO revisions** — after an order is confirmed, changing a PO's `po_qty`, `pcd_date` or `shipment_date` writes `msfl_order_po_revisions`; the sheet shows original / revised 1 / revised 2 (latest).

**Post costing (`Services/PostCosting`)** — budget = approved cost sheet per dozen × order qty; actual material = Inventory issues against the PO (`inv_issues.msfl_order_po_id`, BDT ÷ currency `exchange_rate`), **estimated from budget per pc × packed when no store value exists** (flagged); CM (both sides) = FOB − material − commercial − process − other; reject loss = rejects × budget material / pc.

**Approvals (host central Approvals page)** — modules `msfl.buyer` (`Approvals/BuyerApprovalHandler`, permission `msfl_buyer.approve`) and `msfl.sample` (`Approvals/SampleApprovalHandler`, `msfl_sample.approve`), registered in `MerchandisingSflServiceProvider::registerApprovalModules()`. Buyer `active()` scope = active **and** approved, so unapproved buyers never reach dropdowns or Inventory. Sample decided on its own page → `SampleDecision::closeCentral()` closes the central request.

## Inventory integration (package `SFL/sfl-inventory`)
- **Inventory has no buyer / style entry of its own.** Every Inventory form picks Buyer → Style (→ PO) from v2 via `partials/mer-buyer-style` (or `partials/mer-buyer-select` for buyer-only forms: Item, Gate Pass, Shipment) + request trait `Concerns/PicksMerchandisingStyle`; `MerchandisingLink::formOptions()` feeds them, `resolvePick()` fills inventory `buyer_id` / `style` / `order_ref`. Inventory → Buyers is a read-only list of v2 buyers (+ their styles); store / update / delete are refused. Requisition link (`requisition_merchandising_link`) is on by default.
- Older Inventory styles (style text on earlier Buyer GRNs / FG receives, for inventory buyers whose name matches a v2 buyer) are offered next to v2 styles as `inv:<style no>` (`MerchandisingLink::legacyStyles()`); they save as style text with no `msfl_style_id` / PO. Older records keep their inventory buyer (`inv-buyer:<id>` on edit); old unlinked documents still edit the old way.
- `inv_shipment_items` carries `msfl_order_po_id`; `inv_requisitions / inv_issues / inv_grns / inv_finished_goods_receives / inv_production_consumptions` carry `msfl_buyer_id`, `msfl_style_id`, `msfl_order_po_id`.
- `ME\SflInventory\Services\MerchandisingLink` = the bridge (v2 buyers/styles/POs, validation, `inventoryBuyerId()` maps a v2 buyer to `inv_buyers` by name, `finishSummary()` uses v2 `ProductionFlow` packing pass).
- Buyer Store issue only works if a posted GRN exists for the same inventory buyer + style text — v2 requisitions set both.
- Inventory items need a store (`opening_store_id`). Buyer-supplied GRNs post immediately; issues are created already approved.

## How to add things
- **Master**: migration (`msfl_*`), model using `Concerns/IsMaster`, one `MasterRegistry` entry, permission key in `Config/permission.php`, sidebar entry in `Config/sidebar.php`.
- **Report**: add to `Reports::LIST` + a private method returning `['headers','align','rows','totals'(,'period','status_col')]` — screen and print come for free.
- **Production stage**: `ProductionFlow::STAGES` + `route()`; sidebar (under **Production**); T&A auto source if needed.
- **Page help** ("এই পাতা কী কাজে" box on top of every screen, Bengali): add an entry to `Support/PageHelp::all()` for every new screen / master / stage / report — rendered by `partials/page-help` via `partials/ui-kit`, collapsed by default, only for permission `msfl_page_help.view`.
- **Autofill** (user wants every form to fill itself from earlier steps — never retype): `partials/autofill` (`source` select → `fields` in the same form, maps from `Support/Autofill`: buyers, inquiries, styles, orders, BOM lines from the cost sheet). Fills only empty fields or ones the same source filled; nothing changes on page load. Wired: Inquiry (buyer → merchandiser), Order (inquiry → buyer/season/merchandiser/factory; buyer → terms), Tech Pack (inquiry → season/type/merchandiser/description/SMV), Cost Sheet (style / inquiry → buyer, ref, description, SMV, qty, target price, sizes, currency), Sample (style → merchandiser, order, colors, sizes), PO modal (style → price, ship date), BOM (style → order + "Fill from Cost Sheet"), Cutting (PO → remaining qty per size), Fabric Requisition (PO → items received for the style with balance).
- **Sidebar**: put a new screen under the right top menu — Merchandising / Planning / Production; items render in array order.
- **T&A auto source**: `TnaTemplateTask::autoSources()` + a `match` arm in `TnaPlanner::autoActualDate()`.
- **Permissions/sidebar**: after adding a key, grant it to the role(s) (Super Admin = permission id 1, JSON in `permissions.permission`) or the menu stays hidden.
- **Migrations**: always a new file in `src/database/migrations`; never edit one that has run. Run only this package's file: `php artisan migrate --path=/home/estiaque/Desktop/NIT/SFL/merchandising-sfl/src/database/migrations/<file>.php --realpath --force`. No FKs to `hr_*` / `inv_*`.

## UI conventions (match exactly)
- Bootstrap 4.4 + jQuery + select2 (class `msfl-select2`, include `partials.select2-init`); wrapper `<div class="flex-grow-1 msfl-module">` with `partials.alerts` + `partials.ui-kit`.
- Cards; `table table-bordered table-sm`; `btn-sm`, `form-control-sm`; forms in `col-md-3` (4 per row) via `partials.input` / `partials.select`; filter inputs + **Filter + Reset** buttons in the same row; row actions `btn-custom success|yellow|danger`; deletes through `partials.delete-confirm-modal` (`data-action`).
- Repeating rows: `<template id="{prefix}RowTemplate">` + `tbody#{prefix}RowsBody` + `partials.line-items-script` (`__INDEX__` placeholder).
- **Everything prints on the host's `printMaster2`**, header = `partials/print-header` (logo, company name + address centered, title, subtitle, printed time/user — same look as Inventory's prints; props `title`, `subtitle`, `page` = `@page` size) + `partials/print-kit` (compact tables, Bootstrap grid/badge/text helpers, hides buttons / inline forms / modals / GET filter forms / pagination, drops the Actions column).
  - Show + index pages print themselves with `?print=1` (Inventory's pattern): top `@php $printMode = request()->boolean('print'); @endphp` + `@extends($printMode ? 'printMaster2' : adminTheme() . 'layouts.app')`, title `@if($printMode)…@else<title>…</title>@endif`, wrapper class `msfl-print` when printing, `partials/page-top` (alerts + ui-kit on screen, print header on paper), button `partials/print-button` (keeps the current filters). Lists use `$this->perPage()` (base Controller: all rows when printing). Editable grids switch to read-only in print (e.g. T&A `$editable`).
  - Dedicated prints (reports, sewing board, hourly report, T&A sheet, post costing, bulletin) include `partials/print-header` too.
- Blade gotchas: don't put an inline `@php(...)` before a block `@php … @endphp` in the same view; a directive needs whitespace before it (`other @if(...)`, not `other@if(...)`).
- Pagination: `->links('pagination::bootstrap-5')`.

## Seeders
- `MsflDefaultMasterSeeder` (+ `MsflPlanningSeeder`): sample types, ship modes, currencies, machine types, 53 operations, default 34-task T&A template. Already run on the dev DB.
- `MsflMasterDataSeeder` (calls the default seeder first): real starting masters — Inventory buyers as approved v2 buyers (same name/code), their posted Buyer Store GRN style nos as styles, seasons, product types, wash types, factory SFL, item categories, 29 common items. Through the master routes, skips existing codes. Run on the dev DB 2026-10-07.
- `MsflDemoSeeder`: full demo (codes `D-…`), run on the dev DB 2026-10-06 next to real data: 4 buyers (Zara pending approval), 5 styles via Master Data → Styles (D-1005 has no tech pack), samples in every state, 4 orders (H&M PO D-HM-4501 full route → packed → Finish Store; D-HM-4502 revised + sewing hourly on line 1 incl. today; Primark D-PR-7701 embroidery Front sent / partly returned + sewing on line 2; Next D-NX-9901 waiting; draft order), BOMs, bulletins, T&A, Inventory items `D-INV-*` / machines `D-MC-*` / GRN / issues / FG receive, QC and Rework entries. Enters everything through the real routes (sewing input / hourly, split embroidery / washing, QC / rework); refuses to run twice.

## Verifying changes (recipes that work here)
- **Start here:** `php artisan msfl:overview [masters|orders|dev|planning|production|inventory]` (`Console/Commands/Overview.php`, read-only) prints the live data at once — masters, orders + PO lines (sizes, dates, ids), cost sheets / BOMs / bulletins, lines + HR lines not set up, T&A plans with late steps, production input/pass/WIP per confirmed PO (+ sewing by line), Inventory links. Run it before answering "where does X stand" or deciding anything about data.
- Lint: `php -l <file>`. Compile all views: run Blade's `compileString` over `src/resources/views` and `php -l` the output.
- **Render a page** from CLI: set `APP_RUNNING_IN_CONSOLE=false` (otherwise the host's `general()` is null and `websiteTitle()` crashes), log in a user (id 7 = Super Admin), `$kernel->handle(Request::create('/admin/merchandising-sfl/...','GET'))`. **One page per PHP process** — the host sidebar declares a global `renderMenu()` function.
- **Drive forms (POST/PUT)** in a script: bind `middleware.disable` → `true`, listen to `RouteMatched` and call `router->substituteBindings()` + `substituteImplicitBindings()` (route-model binding is middleware), give the request `app('session.store')`, read `errors` / `error` / `success` from the session; `Gate::before(fn () => true)`, `Mail::fake()`. Re-enable middleware before rendering a page (views need the shared `$errors`).
- Wrap experiments in `DB::beginTransaction()` … `DB::rollBack()`; confirm nothing leaked afterwards.

## Known gaps / open decisions
- **Fabric & Accessories Booking** not built: needs the user's decision — create Inventory purchase requisitions (needs v2 items ↔ Inventory items) or a separate v2 booking record. User chose to keep v2 items separate.
- Process (wash/print/emb) actual cost has no source yet (post costing carries budget).
- Inventory shipment lines carry an optional `msfl_order_po_id` (confirmed POs, `MerchandisingLink::shipmentPos()`, must match the picked buyer); only the Line Wise Output report reads it so far.
- Currency exchange rates are all 1 (seeded) — set real rates in Master Data → Currencies.
- Pre-existing host issues unrelated to v2: some HR pages (`production-rate`, `individual-pay-slip`, `zkteco-data-import`, `attendances/sync-status`) error; host test DB `suhana_erp` not migrated.
